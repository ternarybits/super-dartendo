# Introduction

Super Dartendo is a Super Nintendo emulator written in Dart.  It was originally created as part of a Google Hackathon in 2011, and has been rarely touched since.  I moved it from Google Code to GitHub to prevent it from being lost forever when Google Code shut down.

An unmaintained but potentially working demo of this project can be found at http://dartendo.appspot.com/.
